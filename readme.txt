== Description ==

Very simeple plugin to add shortcode that adds a basic table. Makes work faster, and sometimes cleaner, when you only need a simple one line table... Runs shortcode inside of the tags as needed also allows for CSS styling in the <td>.

The structure:
[qtbl]
<table><tr><td style=" ">

[/qtbl]
</td></tr></table>

Example of usage:
[qtbl style="color: red;"]My Data Is Red[/qtbl]

Maybe later, if people have any interest in seeing this expanded, I will add some admin functionality to add style parameters. Honestly, I think it is more flexible without it as you can then have multiple types of tables on the same page with different formats...
